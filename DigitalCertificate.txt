my_certificate is the alias for your certificate in the key store. Normally you will never use it, but every new certificate in your key store must have its own alias.

my_keystore.pfx is the key store file, which will be generated as the result of the process. It will contain your certificate and a corresponding private key. You will be able to reuse this key store for next certificates you maybe will generate. One key store can contain many certificates.

my_password is the password, that protects your key store file. You will have to enter it every time you want to sign a document.

validity is the number of days your certificate will stay valid. You can enter more than 365.

RSA is the algorithm used to generate the cryptographic keys, corresponding to your certificate.

2048 is the length of the cryptographic keys. The more the length the stronger the signature.

pkcs12 is the format of the key store file. PKCS#12 (a.k.a PFX) key stores can be understood by a lot of different programs and you can also import a PKCS#12 file in your Windows key store (just double click it and follow the instructions).
